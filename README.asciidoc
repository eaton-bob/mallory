== Problems definition
These are the actual problem definitions we are trying to solve.

=== Problem 1:
Evaluate whether to send alert based on 1 .. N measurements.
.Note: For PoC it is enough if the rules/measurements are hardcoded.

=== Problem 2:
Manage the state of alert.
.Motivation: User can acknowledge alarm that he doesn't want to be sent again.
