## Problems definition
These are the actual problem definitions we are trying to solve.

### Problem 1:
Evaluate whether to send alert based on 1 .. N measurements.

### Problem 2:
Manage the state of alert.

**.Bonus points:** Persist acknowledged alerts.

**.Motivation:** User can acknowledge alarm that he doesn't want to be sent again.
