# Test case Nr. 2 for malamute - Work in progress

Protocol

Producer sends message
* COMPUTE/from/to/repeat - Perform magic computation, optionally repeat it
where / means multipart string message, 'from', 'to' and 'repeat' is
a string-encoded unsigned integer, 'repeat' is optional

Consumer replies with one of the following messages
* RESULT/float
* ERROR/reason
where /means multipart string message ...

USAGE (aim)
Lock the main thread with cpu intensive task to (dis)validate the hypotesis
that it blocks the hearbeat thread of malamute thus disconnecting consumer 
from broker

in separate consoles run
malamute malamute.cfs
consumer
producer <from> <to> <repeat>
(e.g.: ./producer 1 2000000000 2 takes ~5 seconds for good measure)

or write a wrapper shell script

TODO
create actor function in producer and simultaneously create producers from code,
it's tedious to do from console
